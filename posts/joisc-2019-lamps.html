            <b>Abridge description:</b> You are given two binary arrays $A$ and $B$, both of size $N$. There are three kinds of operations you can apply on $A$ &mdash;
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Set range $[l, r]$ for any $1 \le l \le r \le N$.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rest range $[l, r]$ for any $1 \le l \le r \le N$.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Toggle range $[l, r]$ for any $1 \le l \le r \le N$.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Find minimum number of operations needed to $A \rightarrow B$.
        </p>

        <p>
            What can we do? Let's investigate the nature of some minimal sequence of operations. Let one of such sequence be $o_1, o_2, \ldots, o_k$ (so $k$ should be the answer, also, denote a operation $o_i = (l_i, r_i, \star_i$)). Now, let's try to understand the impact of one operation on another. Take two operations $o_i$ and $o_j$ ($i < j$). Well... we can barely relate them if $i < j-1$ (when there are some other operations between them). So take some $o_i$ and $o_{i+1}$. Now we may try to fuse them together such that the total number of operations is decreased. But, wait, we picked a minimal sequence right? Yeah, if we can fuse them, that setting isn't possible in a minimal sequence. In this way we can differentiate which settings are possible between two consecutive operations and which settings aren't. There are few cases &mdash;
            <ul>
                <li>
                    $\star_i = \oplus, \star_{i+1} = \oplus$. Most trivial one first. Try drawing all possible ranges, e.g. previous one inside the later one (+ vice-versa), one starts inside another but ends outside etc. If the ranges do not intersect, then we can, to keep things tidy, swap their order if $l_i > l_{i+1}$. From now on, we will try to do this (ordering by $l_i$ and then by $r_i$) whenever possible. If they intersect
