      Week 14 | Another Quite Educational Pset for Noobs & Solutions (COCI)

    <h4><i>10 July, 2021</i></h4>

    <h2>What was discussed?</h2>
    <p>
      This week again trainees were assigned to solve 5 COCI problems for 4
      hours. In my opinion, the problems were super educational for
      beginners, and there was a somewhat hard problem for those who wants a
      challange.
    </p>

    <p>
      Well, problems were a bit hard for beginners' standard... clearly
      reflects in the ranking (sorry :3 can't do more than that for a
      ranklist... I'd rather put effort in teaching one more solution to a
      problem than to waste my time trying to set up a CMS which, by the way,
      I don't know how to do :)).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://oj.uz/problem/view/COCI20_zapina">A - Zapina:</a>
        It was a simple dp problem, just go from left to right (that is, one
        of the states of the dp is what positions I'm currently at), iterate
        over how many problems you want to assign to contestant $i$ from the
        remaining ones (so naturally another state would be the number of
        remaining problems), and then select that many problems... which
        tells us that we should multiply binomial coefficient. Another state
        is a boolean flag, which indicates if we have already one contestant
        that got exactly the amount of problems he wants.
      <p>
        $dp[i,k,f]$ means we are at $i$, have $k$ more problems to
        distribute, and $f=1$ means yes at least one of $[1,k)$ contestants
        is satisfied.
        $$dp[i,k,f] = \sum_{j=0}^{k} \binom{k}{j} \cdot dp[i+1,k-j,f \lor
        [i=j]]$$
        $$dp[N+1,0,1] = 1 \\ dp[N+1,k \ne 0, f] = 0 \\ dp[N+1, k, 0] = 0$$
      </p>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://oj.uz/problem/view/COCI19_grudanje">B - Grudanje:</a>
      Binary search the answer! Let $f(g)$ be true if the string is good
      after time $g$. $f$ has this property that if $f(i)$ is true, then
      $f(i+1)$ is also true. We want to determine the first $i$ such that
      $f(i)$ is true. In order to determine $f(g)$ for a fixed $g$, we can
      use prefix 26 prefix sum arrays...
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://oj.uz/problem/view/COCI19_drvca">C - Drvca:</a> Sort
      the heights, look at the group name of first three heights... AAA, AAB,
      ABA, ABB, BAA, BAB, BBA, BBB we can only have those. Each of them has
      at least two of the same group. Moreover, we can "say" that at least
      one of the groups will have their first two trees from the first three,
      and we will bruteforce all those $\binom{3}{2}$ pairs.
      <p>
        Once we fix the first two of A (wlog), difference of A, $d_A$ is
        fixed. Then we can uniquely determine the sequence A -- go as long as
        you can find first value + $k \cdot d_A$. Assign rest of $h$ to B,
        and check if B is a arithmetic sequence.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this solution has a flaw... look at the following test case.
      </p>
      <img src="./test-case.png">
      <p>
        One participant failed to see this and couldn't debug because of the
        lack of stress testing skills. If you want to learn extensively about
        how to stress test, there's a video in Erricto's channel.
      </p>
      <p>So in order to overcome that flaw, we will now instead try all
      prefixes of the found A to be the first row, and rest assigned to the
      second row. This can be done in $O(n^2)$.</p>
      <p>
        To improve upon that, we will gradually increase the prefix size and
        transfer one element from B to A at a time. And to quickly determine
        if B is an arithmetic sequence, we will maintain a std::multiset of
        adjacent differences of B (when sorted). Each transfer makes $O(1)$
        changes to this multiset. Also to get next/prev value in B, we will
        also need to store B in a multiset.
      </p>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://oj.uz/problem/view/COCI20_nivelle">D - Nivelle:</a> If
      you fix $R$, and move $L$ to the left (starting from $R$), the
      numerator will change at most 26 times. And for the same numerator
      you'll want the denominator to be maximized, that is, to minimize $L$.
      How do we find this changing points? Let $f_c$ be the rightmost index
      $\le R$, where the character $c$ occurs (or some sentinel value if it
      doesn't, and ignore). Sort non-sentinel $f$s in decreasing order.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://oj.uz/problem/view/COCI20_klasika">E - Klasika:</a>
      I'm pretty sure "Klasika" in Croatian means "classic" in English,
      because yes this problems is without any doubt a all time classic.
      Neither did I have the energy to explain everything of this problem,
      nor did I think the participants are prepared enough to learn these
      stuff. However, I took a class on binary tries and max xor problem some
      time ago. Here's the <a
      href="https://mamnoonsiam.github.io/cp-classes/week-10/overview">
      link</a>
      of that. Other than that you need to also learn the following stuff:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Euler tour of tree and how to express each rooted subtree using a
          range.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lowest common ancestor.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Those techniques will get you to a $O(Q \log(n) \log(\max a_i))$
      solution. In order to do even better, you'll need persistent trie. To
      learn more tricks about trees, read the Tree Queries chapter of the
      cses.fi/book.pdf.
